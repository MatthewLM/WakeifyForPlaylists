Wakeify For Playlists
=====================

Copyright 2014 Matthew Mitchell

This is an open-source adaption of [Wakeify](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.matthewmitchell.wakeify), with Playlist support using the Spotify library. It is an Android app which allows you to wake up to Spotify playlists. Please use the [original Wakeify](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.matthewmitchell.wakeify) for a more reliable solution. However, the original Wakeify does not have Playlist support.

To use you will need to use the Android NDK. You will need to place the ARM Spotify library in the jni folder alongside the api.h file and your key.h file which you can obtain from Spotify. Please visit [here](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/libspotify/) for more information.

The app will occasionally crash when playing an alarm, selecting a playlist and logging out. There may be other undiscovered bugs. I have not been able to solve these issues, however others are welcome to try to resolve bugs.

This application has parts derived from [PsyOnSpotify](https://github.com/spotify/psyonspotify).

This application is licensed by the GPLv3, please see the [LICENSE file](https://github.com/MatthewLM/WakeifyForPlaylists/blob/master/LICENSE).
